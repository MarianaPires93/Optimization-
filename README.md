# Optimization-
Optimization Project // Knapsack Problem // Mariana Pires e Duarte Patr√£o

Overview: 
In the course of this project, our primary objective centered around the development of a Python algorithm aimed at producing an optimal solution for the knapsack problem. After careful consideration of various algorithmic approaches, we opted for the implementation of a genetic algorithm. This choice was driven by the algorithm's ability to address combinatorial optimization challenges and its adaptability to diverse problem instances.
Additionally, we developed a ratio-based algorithm for comparison. This approach helps us evaluate how well the genetic algorithm performs compared to a traditional ratio-based solution. The project explores the strengths and weaknesses of both approaches, offering insights into their effectiveness under different scenarios.
